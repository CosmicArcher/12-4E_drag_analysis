# 12-4e-drag
 
HTML version of 12-4E Dragger Data I did on Google Sheets a few years back with added permutation tests to better analyze the available data and to determine if we have sufficient samples or not to draw definitive conclusions rather than the simplistic "which dataset has a lower average or variance?" method employed years prior. \

Additionally included a python notebook of the code which ended up with different results for the permutation tests due to different handling of floating point approximations between JavaScript and Python
